QUESTION: HOW DO I MAKE ACCESS MULTIPLE COLLECTIONS USING ONE QUERY?


GOAL: check if the current user already has a chat with the target user


GOAL: when the user clicks on a user in the search results modal and if the user is viewing another user, then implement the same logic that got the current user but do it for the user that was selected to be viewed by the current user
